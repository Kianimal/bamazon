A mock e-commerce site with a SQL database.

This app uses a CLI to browse a SQL database for products, then allows the user to select a product to make an order.

If enough product exists to fulfill the order, it is performed. Otherwise, it is not an a message stating such is printed. Either way, the program then ends. If an order was performed, the app updates that product quantity in the SQL database.
